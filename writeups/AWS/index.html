    <h1>AWS INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p><strong>By Triddles</strong></p>
    <hr />
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>AWS OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>
        AWS stands for Amazon Web Service. it is a service that offers service such that you can host your information, application on their service for a fee. It is one of the most used web services. they have workstations over the world that host their servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Identity access management(IAM) is one key cocept in AWS. you need IAM to manage wat and which resource a user is entitled to. IAM principals must be authenticated to send requests (with a few exceptions). <br>A principal is a person or an applicaion that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. principals comprises of User, Role, federated user and applicaion. <br>
        Policies control access to resources, it determines whether to authorize the request. everything in AWs is an API call. If you try to get informatiionon an EC2 instance, you will run a "Runinstance" api call. If you want to get informatiion on an S3 bucket, you will run the "GetBucket" call. If you want to create an IAM user you will use use the CreateUser api call.
    </p>
    <h3>SETUP INDIVIDUAL USER ACCOUNT</h3>
    <p>
        there are two types of AWS users. that is;
        <ol>
            <li>Root user: the user is creaated with the email address used when creating an aws account in the first place. This user has full access to aws resources. It is a very poerful user, so it's best practice not to use it often. </li>
            <li>IAM user: A user created by the root user. it has a name and an alias or AWS Account ID. Its action is determined by the IAM permission policy.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>CREATING AN IAM USER</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Search for IAM in the AWS console and select it</li>
            <li>click on add users</li>
            <li>GIve the user a name </li>
            <li>Provide access to AWS management console(optional)</li>
            <li>Select i want to create IAM user</li>
            <li>Set password, it can be auto-generated or custom </li>
            <li>you can choose to let user change passwords at login or not</li>
            <li>click on next</li>
            <li>Add permissions to user(optional)</li>
            <li>Click on next</li>
            <li>Now user will be created, you can login with the credentials you just created.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    One of the best ways to assign permissions to users is through groups. To do that;
        <ol>
            <li>Select user groups in IAM console</li>
            <li>click on create groups</li>
            <li>give the group a nam. eg. Admin</li>
            <li>let's give the admin group full permissions</li>
            <li>you will find a checkbox with the name "AdminstratorAccess", check it</li>
            <li>select group</li>
            when you click on the plus sign next to AdminstratorAccess you will see the policy written in json. Now you're set to add users. you can go into the group and add users.
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD (EC2)</h3>
    <p>
        EC2 is a way we run virtual services in the cloud. EC2 host servers in the cloud for us. It uses server virtuallization. you you launch an instance, you have to choose and instance type. that is, you select your CPU, memory, storage and networking. It determines the hardware performances and the cost. <br>
        To launch an EC2 instance;
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the AWS console and select EC2</li>
            <li>Select instance type</li>
            <li>Select the Amazon Machine Image(AMI) that you want. it selects the operating System(OS) and configuration.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>BENEFITS OF EC2</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Elastic Computing: you can easily launch hundreds of thousand of EC2 instances within minutes</li>
                <li>Complete Control: you control the EC2 instance with full root/administrative access</li>
                <li>Flexible: choose your choice of instance types, operating systems and software packages.</li>
                <li>Reliable: EC2 offers a high levels of availability and instances can be rapidly commissioned and replaced.</li>
                <li>Secure: Fully integrated with AmAzon VPC and security features.</li>
                <li>Inexpensive: Low cost, pay what you use.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>LAUNCHING EC2 INSTANCES(LINUX & WINDOWS)</h4>
            <h5>launching a linux EC2 instance</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Select launch instance in the EC2 page</li>
                <li>Give it a name</li>
                <li>Choose OS image (Amazon Machine Image). The default is Amazon Linux.</li>
                <li>Choose instance type(you will see pricing per hour)</li>
                <li>Create a key pair. it is a private and public key.</li>
                <li>Configure your networking</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leave VPC and sunet, unless you have a vpc and subnet you want to change to.</li>
                        <li>Public IP is allowed</li>
                        <li>Create a new security group and description.</li>
                        <li>Set up rules (allow SSH for now)</li>
                        <li>Source type should be anywhere</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>launch instance</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>WINDOWS</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on launce instance</li>
                <li>Select windows as the OS image</li>
                <li>Choose instance type</li>
                <li>Choose key pair. that is the one we already created. if not create one.</li>
                <li>Configure network settings. leave everything except we configure existing group by selecting existing one </li>
                <li>Launch Instance</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
