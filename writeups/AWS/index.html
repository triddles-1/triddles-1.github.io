    <h1>AWS INTRODUCTION</h1>
    <p><strong>By Triddles</strong></p>
    <hr />
  </header>

  <main>
    <h2>AWS OVERVIEW</h2>
    <p>
        AWS stands for Amazon Web Service. it is a service that offers service such that you can host your information, application on their service for a fee. It is one of the most used web services. they have workstations over the world that host their servers.
    </p>
    <p>
        Identity access management(IAM) is one key cocept in AWS. you need IAM to manage wat and which resource a user is entitled to. IAM principals must be authenticated to send requests (with a few exceptions). <br>A principal is a person or an applicaion that can make a request for an action or operation on an AWS resource. principals comprises of User, Role, federated user and applicaion. <br>
        Policies control access to resources, it determines whether to authorize the request. everything in AWs is an API call. If you try to get informatiionon an EC2 instance, you will run a "Runinstance" api call. If you want to get informatiion on an S3 bucket, you will run the "GetBucket" call. If you want to create an IAM user you will use use the CreateUser api call.
    </p>
    <h3>SETUP INDIVIDUAL USER ACCOUNT</h3>
    <p>
        there are two types of AWS users. that is;
        <ol>
            <li>Root user: the user is creaated with the email address used when creating an aws account in the first place. This user has full access to aws resources. It is a very poerful user, so it's best practice not to use it often. </li>
            <li>IAM user: A user created by the root user. it has a name and an alias or AWS Account ID. Its action is determined by the IAM permission policy.</li>
        </ol>
    <h4>CREATING AN IAM USER</h4>
    <p>
        <ol>
            <li>Search for IAM in the AWS console and select it</li>
            <li>click on add users</li>
            <li>GIve the user a name </li>
            <li>Provide access to AWS management console(optional)</li>
            <li>Select i want to create IAM user</li>
            <li>Set password, it can be auto-generated or custom </li>
            <li>you can choose to let user change passwords at login or not</li>
            <li>click on next</li>
            <li>Add permissions to user(optional)</li>
            <li>Click on next</li>
            <li>Now user will be created, you can login with the credentials you just created.</li>
        </ol>
    </p>
    One of the best ways to assign permissions to users is through groups. To do that;
        <ol>
            <li>Select user groups in IAM console</li>
            <li>click on create groups</li>
            <li>give the group a nam. eg. Admin</li>
            <li>let's give the admin group full permissions</li>
            <li>you will find a checkbox with the name "AdminstratorAccess", check it</li>
            <li>select group</li>
            when you click on the plus sign next to AdminstratorAccess you will see the policy written in json. Now you're set to add users. you can go into the group and add users.
        </ol>
    </p>
    <h3>AMAZON ELASTIC COMPUTE CLOUD (EC2)</h3>
    <p>
        EC2 is a way we run virtual services in the cloud. EC2 host servers in the cloud for us. It uses server virtuallization. you you launch an instance, you have to choose and instance type. that is, you select your CPU, memory, storage and networking. It determines the hardware performances and the cost. <br>
        To launch an EC2 instance;
        <ul>
            <li>Go to the AWS console and select EC2</li>
            <li>Select instance type</li>
            <li>Select the Amazon Machine Image(AMI) that you want. it selects the operating System(OS) and configuration.</li>
        </ul>
        <h4>BENEFITS OF EC2</h4>
        <p>
            <ol>
                <li>Elastic Computing: you can easily launch hundreds of thousand of EC2 instances within minutes</li>
                <li>Complete Control: you control the EC2 instance with full root/administrative access</li>
                <li>Flexible: choose your choice of instance types, operating systems and software packages.</li>
                <li>Reliable: EC2 offers a high levels of availability and instances can be rapidly commissioned and replaced.</li>
                <li>Secure: Fully integrated with AmAzon VPC and security features.</li>
                <li>Inexpensive: Low cost, pay what you use.</li>
            </ol>
            <h4>LAUNCHING EC2 INSTANCES(LINUX & WINDOWS)</h4>
            <h5>launching a linux EC2 instance</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Select launch instance in the EC2 page</li>
                <li>Give it a name</li>
                <li>Choose OS image (Amazon Machine Image). The default is Amazon Linux.</li>
                <li>Choose instance type(you will see pricing per hour)</li>
                <li>Create a key pair. it is a private and public key.</li>
                <li>Configure your networking</li>
                    <ul>
                        <li>Leave VPC and sunet, unless you have a vpc and subnet you want to change to.</li>
                        <li>Public IP is allowed</li>
                        <li>Create a new security group and description.</li>
                        <li>Set up rules (allow SSH for now)</li>
                        <li>Source type should be anywhere</li>
                    </ul>
                <li>launch instance</li>
            </ol>
            <h5>WINDOWS</h5>
            <ol>
                <li>Click on launce instance</li>
                <li>Select windows as the OS image</li>
                <li>Choose instance type</li>
                <li>Choose key pair. that is the one we already created. if not create one.</li>
                <li>Configure network settings. leave everything except we configure existing group by selecting existing one </li>
                <li>Launch Instance</li>
            </ol>
        </p>
    </p>
    <h3>EC2 INSTANCE AND SSH</h3>
    <h4>connectivity Options</h4>
    <table border="1px">
        <tr>
            <th>SSH/PUTTY</th>
            <th>RDP</th>
            <th>EC2 INSTANCE CONNECT</th>
            <th>SESSION MANAGER</th>
        </tr>
        <tr>
            <td>All OS<br>Terminal/CLI<br>SSH daemons<br>Users instance key pair<br>port 22 must be open<br>Anyone with key pair can access instance</td>
            <td>Windows only<br>Desktop/Visual<br>Remote Desktop Service<br>Requires RDP Client<br>port 3389 must be open<br>Need username and password to login</td>
            <td>All OS<br>Terminal/CLI/browser<br>temporary key pair<br>port 22 must be open<br>IAM control via policy</td>
            <td>All OS<br>Terminal/CLI/SSM agent<br>IAM access control<br>no ports must be open<br>IAM access control via policy<br></td>
          </tr>
        
    </table>
    <h3>ACCESSING SERVICES - Access key and IAM roles</h3>
    <p>
      AWS CLI configured with access keys. Acess keys are associated with IAM account. Acess key will use permissions assigned to the IAM user.
      <h4>ACCESS KEYS AND IAM ROLES</h4>
      <ol>
        <li>Launch instance without a keypair</li>
        <li>Change security group to existing</li>
        <li>Connect instance</li>
        <li>when terminal is hosted type <code>aws s3 ls</code></li>
        you will get an error message, because EC2 doesn't have permissions to connect to AWS resources. To enable it, go to IAM &rarr; User &rarr; Select user &rarr; Security credentials &rarr; create access key &rarr; command line interface (CLI) &rarr; Create access key &rarr; download access keys or copy it to a safe place.

      </ol>
      <ul>
        <li>Go back to your instance and type <code>aws configure</code></li>
        <li>Use credentials AWS gave you</li>
        <li>Now run <code>aws s3 mb s3://mytestbucket12</code>(name should be unique)</li>
        <li>now run <code>aws s3 ls</code></li>
        But there is a security concern though, when youn "cd" into ~/.aws . you will find the config and credential file. It is stored in plaintext. you can output it.
      </ul>
      The better way is to create a role. IAM &rarr; roles &rarr; Create roles &rarr; EC2 instance &rarr; AmazonS3ReadOnlyAccess &rarr; give it a name &rarr; back to instance &rarr; actions &rarr; security &rarr; modify IAM role &rarr; S3readonly &rarr; Update role.
      Now you can go to your instance and there will be no security concern.

      Another way to attach role is changing the IAM instance profile to S3readonly during instance creation.
    </p>
    <h4>Amazon virtual private Cloud (VPC)</h4>
    <p>
      Within a region, there are VPCs. VPC is a logically isolated portion of the AWWS cloud within a region. It is private and you have full control. there are Availability Zones(AZ) in VPC. In each availability zone, you can set subnet. you can have multiple ubnets within the same AZ then we deploy EC2 inside them.
      VPC router takes care of routing within the VPC and outside the VPC. If you want to access the internet, you need a gateway. the iternet gateway is attached to a VPC and used to connect to the internet. You can create more VPC within a region, you have 5 limits by default, but you can request for more if you need them.
    </p>
