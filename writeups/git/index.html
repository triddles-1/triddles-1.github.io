    <h1>A beginner introduction to Git 1</h1>

    <p>welcome, you might be wondering why this topic. you‚Äôve come to the right place. Git is a very essential tool as a cybersecurity guy. whether DevOps, offensive security and blue team we all use git. so I put together this blog to aid in your git journey
    
    Git comes preinstalled in some Linux distros but for windows it is not. download git from <a href="https://git-scm.com/downloads">Git download page</a>. select your operating system and download. git will show you how to install it too.</p>
    
    <h2>Git Commits</h2>
    
    <p>we will start with git commit. what is git commit?<br>
    
    A commit in git keeps a history of snapshot of all the files you‚Äôve tracked in your directory. git  also maintains a history of which commits were made and when it was made. Maintaining history is great for everyone working on the project. you get to to know who and when committed to the piece of code.</p>
    
    <h2>Branches</h2>
    
   <p> git branches are just pointers to commits, that all. to make a git branch all you have to type  is <code>‚Äúgit branch [branch_name]‚Äù</code> after that you can now commit that branch. If you want to create a branch and commit at the same time you can use the <code>‚Äúcheckout‚Äù</code>. you just type <code>‚Äúgit checkout -b [branch name]‚Äù</code> .</p>
    
    <h2>Branches and Merging</h2>
    
    <p>Now that we understand how to make commits and create branches, the next step is learning how to merge work from two different branches. This will enable us to create a branch for developing a new feature and later integrate those changes back into the main branch.
    
    the first thing we will learn is <code>‚Äúgit merge‚Äù</code><br>
    
    Merging in Git creates a special commit that has two unique parents. now you can add two branches with different ‚Äúparents‚Äù, and set within either of them.
    
    Lets say you are two people working on a project, and either of you is working on a feature, we can say you both have different branches that you work on. we have two branches; each has one commit that's unique. This means that neither branch includes the entire set of "work" in the repository that you have done.
    
    to merge a branch to a branch eg ‚Äòfeature‚Äô to ‚Äòmain‚Äô you will type <code>‚Äúgit merge feature‚Äù</code></p>
    <h3>Deleting branch</h3>
    <p>you can use the UI from your hosting site to delete branch or you can use the CLI. to delete the branch in CLI, just type <code>git branch -d <i>branch_name</i></code>
    </p>
    <h3>REBASE(To avoid merge conflicts)</h3>
    <p>
      when a change is done remotely and local repository is not aware, when you push code, there will be a conflict. so you have to pull before
      you can push your changes. This might be tedious. the easier way to do it and avod conflict is <code>git pull -r </code>. it pulls the latest remote repo and stack ours to it easily.
      after youre doing rebasing you can now push with <code>git push</code>
    </p>
    <h3>Resolving Merge Conflicts</h3>
    <p>
      when you get a nwerge conflict for changing the same lines of code simultaneously, you will need to manually solve the conflict
      after manually solving it, you use the <code>git rebase --continue</code> to build it up, then yoou push it.
    </p>
    <h3>.gitignore</h3>
    <p>
      .gitignore is not a command but rather a text file that contains some informatiion, telling git to ignore some files.
      <ul>
        <li>Add .gitignore file to your project's root directory</li>
        <li>It is used to exclude certain files or folders from being tracked by git</li>
        <li>folders like build, .ideas and node_modules should not be tracked</li>
        <li>list all folders and files you dont want to be tracked inside .gitignore file</li>
        <li>If there is a tracking on folders because you have already committed some of them, you can use <code>git rm -r --cached <i>file/folder</i></code></li>
        <li>after that, check git status, commit and push</li>
      </ul>
    </p>
    <h3>GIT STASH</h3>
    <p>
      if i made some local changes and i want to switch branch without commiting the changes, maybe im not sure of the codes. when
      you checkout without committing you will get an error. what you need to do is to "stash" it. By typing <code>git stash</code>
      it saves the curent changes for later. now you can checkout to anoter branch without any error message. To get back to your changes
      use <code>git stash pop </code>. <br>
      Another case use is when we ake changes and there's a break in the app. we can use stashing to hide our changes temporarily to test if
      app works without our code changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Checking git history</h3>
    <p>
      <code>git log</code> displays the history of commits and chages we've done across the developments. Each commit gets a <ul>
        <li>unique committ hash</li>
        <li>commit message</li>
        <li>author and date</li>
      </ul>
      use <code>git checkout <i>commit_hash</i></code> to go to a previous Version
    </p>
    <h3>Undoing commits</h3>
    <p>
      when you commit locally without pushing, then you realize that you made a mistake or tere's still some changes to be made. you use "reset --hard HEAD~1" for the 
      last commit. if you want the last but one commit you change it to HEAD~2. <br>
      you can use <code>git reset --soft HEAD~1</code> to keep changes but still be allowed to make changes to the commit. soft is also
      the default option, so even if you remove "-soft" from the command it still works.
      use <code>git commit -amend</code> to amend the commit messages and also doesn't change to the last commit. <br>
      when you push you cant revert with <code>git reset</code> as you did locally, but you can do that with <code>git push --force</code>
      <b>Do not do this in master or develop branch or a branch where a lot of people work together</b>
    </p>
    <p>
      <code>git revert <i>commit_hash</i></code> will revert to a commit assuming there's a lot of commits. it doesn't override
      but creates a new commit that contains the old changes.
    </p>
    <h3>Merging branches</h3>
    <p>
      to merge , first checkout to the branch you want to perform the merge at. use <code>git branch <i>source branch</i></code>
      where source brnch is the branch you want to merge into your working branch, it is mostly the master branch
    </p>
    <h3>Git for DevOps</h3>
    when you are in devops you will get acess to files like;<ul>
      <li>infrastructure as a Service</li>
   
    <ol>
      <li>Kubernetes configuration files</li>
      <li>Terraform and ansible configuration files</li>
      <li>Bash and python scripts</li>
    </ol>
    this files will need some changes wwith time and needs to be tracked. it must be securely stored in one place hence gitlab and
    github. it must be shareable for devops team.
  <li>CI/CD pipeline and Build automation</li>
  <ol>
    <li>    checkout code, test and build application, etc...    </li>
    <li>need integration for the build automation tool with application git repository</li>
    <li>setup integration with build automation tool and git repository</li>
  </ol>
  </ul>
