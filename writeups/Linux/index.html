    <h1>INTRODUCTION TO LINUX</h1>  
    <p><strong>By Triddles</strong></p>
    <hr />
  </header>

  <main>
 <p>every DevOps engineer will have to be proficient in linux to be better at his work. Linux is an operating system which
    is used mostly by security proffesional due to it customizabilty, fast usage and it being open sourced. without further ado let's get into how linux is being
    used in the field.
 </p>
 <p>To create a folder or directory you use the <code>mkdir</code> command</p>Use <code>mkdir new_folder</code> to create
 a directory called "new_folder". <b>NB:</b>linux is case sensitive so "new" and "New" are not the same.<br> 
 use the <code>ls</code> command to list what item inside a directory. it will just list the items but if you want to see all
 items plus hidden ones use <code>ls -a</code>  to list all itemsincluding hidden ones.E.g; ls -a new_folder<br>
 Use the command <code>ls -la</code> to list everything inside of a directoryin a long list manner. E.g; ls -la new_folder
 <p><code>cat</code> is used to read out files or output files to the screen. <br>
<code>touch</code> is used to create empty files. eg. <code>touch new_file</code><br>
<code>echo</code> is used to output strings onto the screen </p>

<h3>FILE PERMISSIONS</h3>
<p>In linux there are different kind of file permissions since it is a multi-user operating system. every user is assigned it's 
    own permissions. userA cant have access to userB without the proper permissions. when you list a directory with <code>ls -la</code>
therefore making it list out all hidden items and normal  items with their permissions, you will see something like <code>drwxrwxrwx</code>. 
now it has a meaning. <br>
<ol>
    <li><code>d</code>stands for directory. that is if that particular item is a directory, if its not it will be replaced with a dash</li>
    <li><code>r</code>stand for read. that is if the user has read permissions on the file</li>
    <li><code>w</code>stands for write. that is if the user has write permissions on the file</li>
    <li><code>x</code>stands for executable. that is if the user can execute a particular file or script. </li>
</ol>
now that we know what it means lets go back and look at the permissions again, you will find out that the <code>rwx</code> appears thrice.
the reason is every user has a group they belong to. so the first rwx of the permission belong to the user, the next one belongs to the group the user is in. 
and the last one belongs to other categories.
</p>
<h3>CHANGING PERMISSIONS</h3>
<p>you might get to a time that you will want to change permissions of a user on a particular file, Linux gives us the opportunity to
    change permissions. first of all, to change permission you must be root or a sudo user. a sudo user is a user that can temporarily Use
    the root for sometime. The command to change permission is <code>chmod</code>. to remove the read and write permissio from the 
    group, one can type <code>sudo chmod g-rw new_file</code>you will get the end result like <code>rwx--x-rwx</code>. This will remove
    the permission of the group and replace it with dashes. 
</p>
<h3>CHANGING GROUP</h3>
<p>To change the group a file belongs to, you will need the <code>chgrp</code> command. it changes the group a file belongs to, 
    thereby making sure users in that group get access to it. all youhave to do is type <code>sudo chgrp "group_name" file_name</code> eg.
    <code>sudo chgrp triddles new_file</code> this changes whatever group there to triddles group.
</p>
<h3>CHANGING OWNERSHIP</h3>
<p>to change the ownwership of a file from userA to another user, we use the <code>chown</code> command. we type out <code>sudo chown old_owner:new_owner</new_ownwer></old_owner></code> </p>
